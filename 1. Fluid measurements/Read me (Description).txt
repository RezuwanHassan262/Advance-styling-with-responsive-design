Note: Before, Both Horizontal and vertical bars showed up as all the contents didn't fit neither horizontally or vertically.
But, Only Vertical bar showed up as things improved and all the contents fitted at least horizontally.

I only edited the CSS code and changed the background color and introduced fluid measurements by replacing some of the hardcoded values with percentages.
I also changed or introduced display property in places where it was necessary to make the site responsive.
You can check out the before-after css codes to see the differences yourself
